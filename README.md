# ayu-iterm2

[Ayu](https://github.com/ayu-theme) color presets for [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) that *should* match [ayu-vim](https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-vim) (and [its fork](https://github.com/luxed/ayu-vim) too) rather well.

## Installation

Open iTerm2 preferences and import the color presets to your profile. Works best with the *Minimal* theme (*Appearance* tab).
